                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Our story began with a simple yet powerful belief: that periods are a natural and normal part of life, not something to be hidden or ashamed of. We were tired of the stigma surrounding menstruation and the lack of open conversation about it. So, we set out to create a tampon brand that not only provided high-quality products but also aimed to normalize periods and empower people who menstruate. Through inclusive marketing campaigns, educational resources, and community initiatives, we strive to break down barriers and foster a culture where periods are celebrated, not hidden away. Our mission is to make every person feel confident, comfortable, and proud during their period because we believe that everyone deserves to embrace their bodies and live free from shame.</p>
                <p>Based on the belif that periods are a natural and normal part of life, our found got to work. Maya, a biochemist, worked tirelessly to create tampons made from 100% organic cotton, ensuring they were not only safe and comfortable but also environmentally friendly. Emily, a marketing whiz, focused on branding and messaging, crafting campaigns that celebrated the natural rhythms of the female body.</p>

        <h2> Our Founders </h2>
        <p>Our founders, Maya, and Emily, had experienced firsthand the discomfort and stigma associated with menstruation. They believed that periods should be normalized and celebrated, not whispered about in hushed tones. So, armed with a vision and a determination to challenge societal taboos, they set out to create a tampon brand that did more than just provide products â€“ it aimed to empower women. </p>
